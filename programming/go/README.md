### _Go Commands_

* `go run main.go`  _-> Run a file_
* `go build hello.go`  -> this command should create an executable file with the name _hello_
* `$ go build -ldflags "-w -s"` will reduce the binary size by approximately 30 percent:
* `go doc fmt.Println`  -> The go doc command lets you interrogate documentation about a package, function, method, or variable
* `go get` -> To obtain package source code
* `go get github.com/stacktitan/ldapauth`
* `go fmt` Automatically formats your source code
* `go vet` Attempts to identify issues, some of which might be legitimate bugs, that a compiler might miss
* `golint` reports style mistakes such as missing comments, variable naming that doesnâ€™t follow conventions, useless type specifications, and more
* use the `go test` tool to run unit tests and benchmarks, cover to check for test coverage, imports to fix import statements, and more.
